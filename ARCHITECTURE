System Architecture

The Digital Storage System (DSS) is designed to be a centralized location for the 
medium-term storage of digital objects.  The system provides for bitwise preservation,
also known as fixity, meaning that the bits of the digital objects placed in the system 
will remain intact.  The system uses an MD5 hash of each file to monitor file
integrity.

To ensure that file integrity can be maintained over a long period of time, the DSS uses
three physically diverse server, also known as storage pods.  One server is
designated as the primary server and digital objects are uploaded by the user to this
server.  The other two servers act as hot backups.  Having three copies of every
object on physically diverse servers provides a high level of digital preservation.

Each server should be configured the same, with a separate filesystem for the storage of
the digital objects that will placed there.  In addition, it is best to keep the
document root for the DSS on this filesystem also so that the thumbnails and preview
images that are created by the system are copied to the backup servers for save keeping.

The method used to backup the servers is rsync -- a Unix utility that will examine and
synchronize a remote filesystem with a primary filesystem.  The BACKUP shell script 
provided performs this task.  Typically, the primary server is rsynced to the first
backup server overnight.  The first backup server is then rsynced to the secondary
backup server the next day.  This allows the primary server to be unloaded during the
workday so that it remains responsive to users.

The BACKUP shell script executes a PHP script to verify the checksum of every file in
the DSS.  If the checksum for any file no longer matches what is in the database, the
backup is cancelled and the administrators are notified by email.
