Digital Storage System (DSS) Installation Instructions

The DSS requires:
	PHP 5 or greater,
	MySQL 5 or greater,
	

You should create a separate (HUGE) filesystem for the DSS to use.  This will allow you 
to rsync the digital items placed on your primary storage system to your backup storage 
systems.  See the ARCHITECTURE file for details.

1.	Move the 'www' directory to the document root for your web server. This should be on  
	the same filesystem where your digital items will live so that thumbnails and preview 
	images are copied to your backup systems along with the files.
	
2.	Create the MySQL database that you will use. The default database name used in the 
	configuration file is: DSS

3.	Load the dss.sql file into the MySQL database that you just created.

4.	Edit the configuration file: www/resources/inc.config.php  Each setting is described 
	in that file.

5.	Edit the utilities file: www/resources/inc.utilities.php and update the 
	verify_password function so that it works properly for your institution.  The
	default code will allow you to login as 'dssadmin' with a password of 'dssadmin'.
	
6.	Review and edit the sample automation shell scripts: backup.sh and backup_files.sh
	A sample crontab file is provided as an example of how ofter to execute the various
	automation scripts.

7.	Read the Help files for more information about configuring the system via the Admin
	menu.
